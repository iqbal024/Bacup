        On behalf of the Cardiovascular Department of Udayana University, it
        gives us great pleasure to extend our warmest welcome to you all in
        joining the 9th BALI Cardiology Update which will be held on 11-13
        December 2020 and 18-20 December 2020 due to the limited situation and
        conditions amid the COVID-19 pandemic. We are from the organizing
        committee decided to continue to hold symposia and workshop with the
        consideration of continuing to develop in the scientific field of
        cardiology in all kinds of situations including during a pandemic like
        this time. BAC-UP this year is not ordinary because we are holding it in
        the midst of a pandemic with the concept of a Webinar via Zoom Cloud
        Meetings.

        Cardiovascular disease, together with the control of its various risk
        factors, is a global challenge. It is associated with significant
        morbidity, mortality and economic loss. It is thus one of the goals of
        public health to reduce the incidence and prevalence, and manage the
        problems of cardiovascular disease in different parts of the world,
        including South East Asia.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are proud to see that the conference has become a well-known
        professional platform for colleagues working or interested in the field
        of Present and Future Challenges in Cardiovascular Care from Bali and
        different parts of Indonesia to learn and to share research findings,
        experience and views. The unprecedented challenge from the COVID-19
        pandemic is huge but yet has motivated us to be more innovative in
        professional education. We are going to present a high-quality and
        comprehensive program in preventive cardiology, disease management and
        cardiac rehabilitation via a novel approach of hybrid conference. While
        the conventional physical participation by speakers and other delegates
        is maintained, a virtual conference is enabled simultaneously. The theme
        of the upcoming 9th BAC-UP is “Present and Future Challenges in
        Cardiovascular Care”.
      </p>
      <p>
        A group of dedicated experts will be gathered to present a 6-day
        programme which covers a wide spectrum of topics of interest, latest
        advancement and controversies in cardiovascular prevention,
        rehabilitation and management. Riding on the success of the previous
        conferences, this year we will also organize joint sessions with
        professional associations to share experience among different city and
        exchange ideas in present and future challenging in cardiovascular care.
        A public conference will be held at the same time to educate patients,
        their carers and the general public to enhance awareness on
        cardiovascular disease and improve the attitude and behaviour of them in
        self-management.
      </p>
      <p>
        We sincerely invite you to join us in this very educational annual
        conference and collaborate in the global action in reducing the burden
        of cardiovascular diseases.
